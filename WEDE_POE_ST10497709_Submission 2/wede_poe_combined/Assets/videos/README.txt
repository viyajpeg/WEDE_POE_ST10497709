Place your background video files here:

- homepagebackgroundvideo.mp4
- homepagebackgroundvideo.webm (optional)

Recommended:
- Keep mp4 H.264 encoded for broad browser support.
- Provide a webm fallback for smaller file sizes when possible.
- Use a short loopable clip (5–20s) and optimize for web (compress to ~1–5 MB).

If you want me to add a real sample video file locally, upload the file here or tell me a remote URL and I can reference it in the page.
